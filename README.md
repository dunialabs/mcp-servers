# Peta MCP Servers

A collection of MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers for Peta Core, created by Dunia Labs

These are MCP servers optimized for efficient and effective use with Peta Core. They can be connected to Peta Core and configured directly for immediate use, or run independently without Peta.

When used with Peta Core, you get:

- Secure credential management — API credentials and sensitive information are stored in the vault, never exposed externally, and accessed only when needed
- Multi-tenant support — Serve multiple users or organizations from a single deployment
- Granular permissions — Assign different access levels and permissions to different API keys
- Human-in-the-loop approval — Require explicit human approval for risky or sensitive operations before execution

## Getting Started

Each MCP server has its own documentation and setup instructions. Navigate to the specific server directory and read its README for detailed information.

### General Prerequisites

Most servers in this repository require:
- Node.js 18+ or compatible runtime
- npm or yarn package manager
- Appropriate API credentials or access tokens for the service being integrated

### Installation

Each server can be installed and run independently:

```bash
# Navigate to the specific server directory
cd mcp-google-drive

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Configure environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your credentials

# Build the server
npm run build

# Run the server (if applicable)
npm start
```

## Creating a New MCP Server

To create a new MCP server in this repository:

1. Copy the `mcp-server-template` directory:
   ```bash
   cp -r mcp-server-template mcp-your-new-server
   cd mcp-your-new-server
   ```

2. Follow the checklist in `NEW_PROJECT_CHECKLIST.md`

3. Read `TEMPLATE_GUIDE.md` for detailed instructions

4. Implement your server logic in the `src/` directory

5. Update the main README.md to include your new server

## Development Guidelines

- Each server should be self-contained with its own dependencies
- Follow TypeScript best practices
- Include comprehensive documentation
- Add tests for critical functionality
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Follow the MCP specification
